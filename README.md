# GIMP-MCP: Integrating GIMP with AI through Model Context Protocol

**GIMP-MCP** is an initiative to integrate the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** into the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), enabling seamless interaction between GIMP and AI models. This integration allows users to harness advanced AI capabilities directly within GIMP, enhancing image editing workflows with intelligent automation and context-aware operations.

## Introduction

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard developed to facilitate seamless integration between AI systems and external applications. By implementing MCP within GIMP, users can leverage AI models for tasks such as object recognition, style transfer, and automated enhancements, thereby extending GIMP's native functionalities.

## Features

- **AI Integration**: Connect GIMP with state-of-the-art AI models for enhanced image processing capabilities.
- **Automated Workflows**: Utilize AI to perform repetitive tasks, allowing for more efficient editing processes.
- **Context-Aware Operations**: AI models can interpret and manipulate images based on contextual understanding, leading to more intelligent edits.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before integrating MCP with GIMP, ensure you have the following:

- **GIMP 3.0** or later installed on your system.
- **Python 3.x** installed.
- Basic knowledge of Python scripting and GIMP's plugin architecture.

### Setting Up the MCP Server

1. **Clone the MCP Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SgtRaccoon/gimp-mcp.git
   cd servers
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:
   Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the MCP Server:
   Start the server to enable communication between GIMP and AI models:  
   `python mcp_server.py`


## Integrating MCP with GIMP
1. Locate GIMP’s Plugin Directory:
   - Linux: ~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/
   - Windows: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\3.0\plug-ins\
   - macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/
2. Copy the Plugin File:
	 - Create a directory in the plug-ins folder named gimp-mcp-plugin.
   - Place the gimp-mcp-plugin.py file into the newly created directory.
3. Make the Plugin Executable (Linux/macOS):
   - `chmod +x ~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/gimp-mcp-plugin/gimp-mcp-plugin.py`
4. Restart GIMP:
   - Relaunch GIMP to recognize the new plugin. You should see Start MCP Server under Filters > Development.

## Usage Examples

**Human-AI Interaction Prompts**

To effectively utilize AI within GIMP via MCP, consider the following interaction prompts:
- Object Recognition:
- Prompt: “Identify and select all objects in the image.”
- AI Response: The AI highlights and categorizes each object detected.
- Style Transfer:
- Prompt: “Apply Van Gogh’s Starry Night style to the current image.”
- AI Response: The image is transformed to emulate the specified artistic style.
- Image Enhancement:
- Prompt: “Enhance the image resolution and reduce noise.”
- AI Response: The AI upscales the image and applies noise reduction techniques.

**Available API Commands**

The following are some of the API commands available through the MCP integration:
- gimp_image_new: Create a new image.
- gimp_layer_new: Add a new layer to an image.
- gimp_text_layer_new: Create a new text layer.
- gimp_file_load: Load an image file.
- gimp_file_save: Save the current image to a file.
- gimp_edit_fill: Fill a selection or layer with a specified color.
- gimp_context_set_foreground: Set the foreground color.
- gimp_layer_set_offsets: Set the position of a layer within an image.

For a comprehensive list of commands and their parameters, refer to the GIMP Python API documentation.
